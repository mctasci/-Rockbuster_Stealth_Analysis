*
This SQL query analyzes whether sales figures vary across different geographic regions by aggregating total sales per country.
It utilizes JOIN operations to merge data across multiple tables, including payment, customer, address, city, and country tables.
By grouping the results by country and ordering them by total sales in descending order, this query highlights regions with the highest sales,
providing insights into geographic market performance and helping to guide regional sales strategies.
